        <h1>Decentralised Synthetic Assets</h1>
        <p><b>Oikos</b> is a Tron port of <b>Synthetix</b>: a synthetic asset
        platform that provides on-chain exposure to fiat currencies,
        commodities, stocks, and indices. Synthetic assets (Synths) are backed
        by <b>Oikos Network Tokens</b> (OKS) locked into a smart contract as
        collateral. Synths track the prices of various assets, allowing
        crypto-native and unbanked users to trade P2C (peer-to-contract) on
        <b>Oikos Exchange</b> without liquidity limitations.</p>

        <h1>Features</h1>

        <h2>750% collateralisation required</h2>
        <p><b>Oikos</b> requires 750% collateralisation for Synth issuance. So
        if you want to mint a hundred synthetic US dollars (sUSD), you’d need
        the equivalent of US$750 of <b>OKS</b> tokens as collateral. This
        creates a generous buffer for Synths in circulation.</p>

        <h2>Debt-driven</h2>
        <p>When someone mints new Synths, their 750% <b>OKS</b> collateral is
        locked up, while the value of the issued Synths takes the form of
        outstanding debt. To unlock their collateral, a person needs to pay
        back their share of the global debt by burning Synths.  The 750%
        collateral requirement helps ensure that Synths remain collateralized
        even through wild market price fluctuations.</p>

        <h2>Exchange fees and staking rewards</h2>

        <p>
          By locking up <b>OKS</b>, issuing Synths and taking on the debt of
          those Synths, one also becomes a staker and starts earning staking
          rewards. These take the form of a portion of the Oikos Exchange fees
          as well as a share of the inflationary supply.  The exchange fees are
          currently set at 0.3% per trade. They are put into a pool, where they
          can be claimed by stakers proportionate to their outstanding debt. So
          the more Synths someone issues, the more staking fees they earn.
          However, they can only earn staking rewards if they maintain a ~750%
          collateralisation ratio. This incentivises people to actively
          maintain their personal 750% ratios.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h1>Airdrop for Synthetix token holders</h1>
        <p>
          Oikos will take a snapshot of the Ethereum blockchain at a definite block
          height and distribute a portion of OKS token to existing Synthetix token 
          holders. This will help bootstrap our initial economy and reward both
          Synthetix and its users.
         </p>
        <h2>Oikos Exchange</h2>
        <p> The <b>Oikos</b> decentralized exchange lets people buy and sell
        Synths via OKS and smart contract, without needing to rely on third
        parties to be on the other end of the trade.</p>
        <h2>Inflation</h2>
        <p>There is also system inflation, with the total amount of <b>OKS</b>
        in circulation set to increase from the initial 100 million to around
        250 million by 2024.  This inflation will also be distributed to Synth
        issuers.</p>
        <h2>Debt pools</h2>
        <p>All Synths in circulation add up to the global debt of the system. A
        Synth issuer’s individual debt is simply registered as a percentage of
        this global debt. The USD value of this debt changes constantly based
        on price fluctuations of the assets tracked and their quantity in
        circulation. Therefore, issuers act as a pooled counterparty to all
        Synth exchanges and take on the risk of the overall debt in the system.
        They have the option to hedge this risk by taking positions external to
        the system.
        </p>

        <p>This system enables what is known as "infinite liquidity" trades:
        it's possible to convert any amount of Synths to another at a fixed
        price.</p>

        <h1>COVID-19</h1>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of the system, it's possible to create all kinds of
          synthetic assets. For example, Oikos is planning to release a
          COVID-19 Synth which will track a basket of companies with a great
          involvement in fighting the current worldwide epidemic.

        <h1>Trustless Token Exchange</h1>
       <p> <b>Oikos Swap </b>is a Tron port of Uniswap: a trustless
       decentralized exchange that allows users to trade any Tron-based token
       without any deposits or withdrawals to a centralized order book. Better
       yet, Oikos Swap liquidity pools have little to no slippage for the vast
       majority of transactions. Anyone can contribute by adding or removing
       liquidity to gain commissions in the form of exchange fees as well as
       rewards paid in <b>OKS</b> token.</p>

        <h2>Automated 24/7 Trading</h2>
        <p><b>Oikos Swap </b> lets you trade tokens any time of day or night.
        All trades are executed via a decentralized smart contract.</p>

        <h2>Trade TRC-20 Tokens</h2>
        <p>Oikos Swap lets you trade TRC-20 protocol tokens on the Tron blockchain.</p>

        <h2>Decentralized Exchange</h2>
        <p><b>Oikos Swap </b> is like a decentralized exchange in that you can
        trade tokens without the intervention of a centralized third party.
        However, it’s different from a decentralized exchange in that there’s
        no real P2P "exchange" taking place. You’re swapping
        tokens with a liquidity pool.</p>

        <h2>Runs in Perpetuity</h2>
        <p><b>Oikos Swap </b> cannot be stopped. The protocol will run in
        perpetuity for as long as the Tron network is running.</p>

        <h2>Can Handle Orders of Any Size</h2>
        <p><b>Oikos Swap </b> can technically handle any size of order – from 0
        to infinity. The protocol uses an asymptotic curve to increase the
        price of the coin as the desired quantity increases. This means
        <b>Oikos Swap </b> can handle orders of any size, but really large
        orders are prohibitively expensive after a certain limit.</p>
