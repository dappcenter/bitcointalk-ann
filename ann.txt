[size=30pt][font=Montserrat][color=#46bf89][b]Decentralized Synthetic Asset[/b][/color][/font][/size].
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos[/b] is a Tron port of Synthetix: a synthetic asset platform that provides on-chain exposure to fiat currencies,commodities, stocks, and indices. Synthetic assets (Synths) are backed by [b]Oikos Network Tokens[/b] (OKS) locked into a smart contract as collateral. Synths track the prices of various assets, allowing crypto-native and unbanked users to trade P2C (peer-to-contract) on [b]Oikos Exchange[/b] without liquidity limitations.[/color][/size]
[size=30pt][font=Montserrat][b][color=#46bf89][/color][/b][/font][/size].

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]750% collateralisation required[/color][/size] 
       
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos[/b] requires 750% collateralisation for Synth issuance. So if you want to mint a hundred synthetic US dollars (USD), you’d need the equivalent of US$750 of [b]OKS[/b] tokens as collateral. This creates a generous buffer for Synths in circulation.[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Debt-driven[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]When someone mints new Synths, their 750% [b]OKS[/b] collateral is locked up, while the value of the issued Synths takes the form of outstanding debt. To unlock their collateral, a person needs to pay back their share of the global debt by burning Synths. The 750% collateral requirement helps ensure that Synths remain collateralized even through wild market price fluctuations.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Exchange fees and staking rewards[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]By locking up [b]OKS[/b], issuing Synths and taking on the debt of those Synths, one also becomes a [b]staker[/b] and starts earning [b]staking rewards[/b]. These take the form of a portion of the [b]Oikos Exchange[/b] fees as well as a share of the inflationary supply. The exchange fees are currently set at 0.3% per trade. They are put into a pool, where they can be claimed by stakers proportionate to their outstanding debt. So the more Synths someone issues, the more staking fees they earn. However, they can only earn staking rewards if they maintain a ~750% collateralisation ratio. This incentivises people to actively maintain their personal 750% ratios.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Oikos Exchange[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]The Oikos decentralized exchange lets people buy and sell Synths via [b]OKS[/b] and smart contract, without needing to rely on third parties to be on the other end of the trade.
[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Inflation[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]There is also system inflation, with the total amount of [b]OKS[/b] in circulation set to increase from the initial 100 million to around 250 million by 2026. This inflation will also be distributed to Synth issuers.
[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Debt pools[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]All Synths in circulation add up to the global debt of the system. A Synth issuer’s individual debt is simply registered as a percentage of this global debt. The USD value of this debt changes constantly based on price fluctuations of the assets tracked and their quantity in circulation. Therefore, issuers act as a pooled counterparty to all Synth exchanges and take on the risk of the overall debt in the system. They have the option to hedge this risk by taking positions external to the system.

This system enables what is known as "infinite liquidity" trades: it's possible to convert any amount of Synths to another at a fixed price.[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]COVID-19[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]Due to the nature of the system, it's possible to create all kinds of synthetic assets. For example, Oikos is planning to release a COVID-19 Synth which will track a basket of companies with a great involvement in fighting the current worldwide epidemic.[/color][/size]

[size=30pt][color=#46bf89][b]Trustless Token Exchange[/b][/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] is a Tron port of Uniswap: a trustless decentralized exchange that allows users to trade any Tron-based token without any deposits or withdrawals to a centralized order book. Better yet, [b]Oikos Swap[/b] liquidity pools have little to no slippage for the vast majority of transactions. Anyone can contribute by adding or removing liquidity to gain commissions in the form of exchange fees as well as rewards paid in [b]OKS[/b] token.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Automated 24/7 Trading[/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] lets you trade tokens any time of day or night. All trades are executed via a decentralized smart contract.[/color][/size] 

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Trade TRC-20 Tokens[/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] lets you trade TRC-20 protocol tokens on the Tron blockchain.[/color][/size] 

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Decentralized Exchange[/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] is like a decentralized exchange in that you can trade tokens without the intervention of a centralized third party. However, it’s different from a decentralized exchange in that there’s no real P2P "exchange" taking place. You’re swapping tokens with a liquidity pool.[/color][/size] 

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Runs in Perpetuity[/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] cannot be stopped. The protocol will run in perpetuity for as long as the Tron network is running.[/color][/size] 

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Can Handle Orders of Any Size[/color][/size] 
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos Swap[/b] can technically handle any size of order – from 0 to infinity. The protocol uses an asymptotic curve to increase the price of the coin as the desired quantity increases. This means [b]Oikos Swap[/b] can handle orders of any size but really  large orders are prohibitively expensive after a certain limit.[/color][/size] 

[size=24pt][font=Montserrat][b][color=#46bf89]Airdrop for Synthetix token holders[/color][/b][/font][/size].

[size=14pt][color=#424242]Oikos will take a snapshot of the Ethereum blockchain at a definite block height and distribute a portion of [b]OKS[/b] token to existing Synthetix token holders. This will help bootstrap our initial economy and reward both Synthetix and its users.
