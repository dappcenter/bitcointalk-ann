[size=30pt][font=Montserrat][b][color=#46bf89]Decentralized Synthetic Asset[/color][/b][/font][/size].
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos[/b] is a Tron port of [b]Synthetix[/b]: a synthetic asset platform that provides on-chain exposure to fiat 
currencies,commodities, stocks, and indices. Synthetic assets (Synths) are backed by [b]Oikos Network Tokens[/b] (OKS) 
locked into a smart contract as collateral. Synths track the prices of various assets, allowing crypto-native and unbanked
users to trade P2C (peer-to-contract) on [b]Oikos Exchange[/b] without liquidity limitations.[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]750% collateralisation required[/color][/size] 
       
[size=14pt][color=#424242][b]Oikos[/b] requires 750% collateralisation for Synth issuance. So if you want to mint a hundred synthetic US dollars (USD)
you’d need the equivalent of US$750 of [b]OKS[/b] tokens as collateral. This creates a generous buffer for Synths in circulation.[/color][/size]

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Debt-driven[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]When someone mints new Synths, their 750% [b]OKS[/b] collateral is locked up, while the value of the issued Synths takes
the form of outstanding debt. To unlock their collateral, a person needs to pay back their share of the global debt by burning 
Synths. The 750% collateral requirement helps ensure that Synths remain collateralized even through wild market price 
fluctuations.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Exchange fees and staking rewards[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]By locking up OKS, issuing Synths and taking on the debt of those Synths, one also becomes a staker and starts earning 
staking rewards. These take the form of a portion of the Oikos Exchange fees as well as a share of the inflationary supply. 
The exchange fees are currently set at 0.3% per trade. They are put into a pool, where they can be claimed by stakers 
proportionate to their outstanding debt. So the more Synths someone issues, the more staking fees they earn. 
However, they can only earn staking rewards if they maintain a ~750% collateralisation ratio. 
This incentivises people to actively maintain their personal 750% ratios.

[size=30pt][font=Montserrat][b][color=#46bf89]Airdrop for Synthetix token holders[/color][/b][/font][/size].

[size=14pt][color=#424242]Oikos will take a snapshot of the Ethereum blockchain at a definite block height and distribute a portion of OKS token 
to existing Synthetix token holders. This will help bootstrap our initial economy and reward both Synthetix and its users.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Oikos Exchange[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]The Oikos decentralized exchange lets people buy and sell Synths via OKS and smart contract, without needing to rely on 
third parties to be on the other end of the trade.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Inflation[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]There is also system inflation, with the total amount of OKS in circulation set to increase from the initial 100 million to 
around 250 million by 2024. This inflation will also be distributed to Synth issuers.

[size=24pt][color=#46bf89]Debt pools[/color][/size] 

[size=14pt][color=#424242]All Synths in circulation add up to the global debt of the system. A Synth issuer’s individual debt is simply registered as a 
percentage of this global debt. The USD value of this debt changes constantly based on price fluctuations of the assets tracked and their quantity in 
circulation. Therefore, issuers act as a pooled counterparty to all Synth exchanges and take on the risk of the overall debt in the system. 
They have the option to hedge this risk by taking positions external to the system.

This system enables what is known as "infinite liquidity" trades: it's possible to convert any amount of Synths to another at a fixed price.

COVID-19
Due to the nature of the system, it's possible to create all kinds of synthetic assets. For example, Oikos is planning to release a COVID-19 Synth which will track a basket of companies with a great involvement in fighting the current worldwide epidemic.
